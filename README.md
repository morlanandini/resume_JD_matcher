Resume Matching Analysis Tool
The Resume Matching Analysis Tool is a Streamlit-based application designed to help job seekers optimize their resumes for specific job descriptions. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) and a large language model (LLM), the tool analyzes the content of a resume and compares it to a provided job description. It calculates a match percentage based on overlapping skills, tools, and experiences, and provides actionable suggestions to improve the resume for better alignment with the job requirements.
